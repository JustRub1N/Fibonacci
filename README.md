Fast Java Fibonacci Sequence Number Finder
This is my first project on GitHub. It’s a simple, efficient implementation of an algorithm to calculate Fibonacci numbers using matrix exponentiation.
The algorithm is designed to be fast, with a time complexity of O(log n), making it much more efficient than traditional methods.

The code uses Java’s BigInteger class to handle large numbers without overflow. It works by raising a 2x2 matrix to the power of n−1, which allows to calculate big Fibonacci numbers quickly.

Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
